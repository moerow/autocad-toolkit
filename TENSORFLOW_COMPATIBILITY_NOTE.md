# TensorFlow Compatibility Note

## ⚠️ Python 3.13 Compatibility Issue

Your current virtual environment is using **Python 3.13.5**, which is not yet supported by TensorFlow.

### TensorFlow Requirements:
- **Python 3.9 - 3.12** (recommended: Python 3.11)
- TensorFlow does not yet support Python 3.13

## 🔧 Solutions

### Option 1: Use Fallback Mode (Current Setup)
The AI system has been designed with automatic fallback:
- When TensorFlow is not available, the system will use traditional dimensioning
- All other features work normally
- Dashboard and training interface will show appropriate warnings

### Option 2: Create New Virtual Environment with Python 3.11
```bash
# Install Python 3.11 from python.org
# Then create new virtual environment:
python3.11 -m venv venv_tf
venv_tf\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install tensorflow>=2.13.0
```

### Option 3: Use Alternative ML Libraries
For basic AI functionality without TensorFlow:
- **scikit-learn** ✅ (Already installed)
- **XGBoost** - Gradient boosting
- **LightGBM** - Fast gradient boosting

## 📦 Currently Installed AI Packages

✅ Successfully installed in your Python 3.13 environment:
- **keras** 3.10.0 - High-level neural networks API
- **keras-tuner** 1.4.7 - Hyperparameter tuning
- **scikit-learn** 1.7.0 - Machine learning library
- **numpy** 2.3.1 - Numerical computing
- **pandas** 2.3.1 - Data manipulation
- **streamlit** 1.46.1 - Dashboard framework
- **plotly** 6.2.0 - Interactive visualizations

## 🚀 Impact on AI System

The AI dimensioning system will work with these limitations:
1. **Training**: Will need TensorFlow-compatible Python version
2. **Inference**: Can use pre-trained models with Keras (if available)
3. **Fallback**: Automatic fallback to traditional dimensioning
4. **Dashboard**: Fully functional for monitoring and statistics

## 📋 Recommendation

For full AI functionality:
1. Keep current setup for development and traditional features
2. Create separate Python 3.11 environment for AI training
3. Use pre-trained models for production deployment

The system is designed to be resilient and will work either way!
