# 🚀 GitHub Setup Instructions

Your AutoCAD Construction Toolkit is ready for GitHub! Everything has been prepared.

## ✅ What's Already Done
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ All files committed with professional commit message  
- ✅ .gitignore configured (excludes venv/, logs/, etc.)
- ✅ Branch set to `main` (modern GitHub standard)

## 🔧 What You Need To Do

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `autocad-construction-toolkit` (or whatever you prefer)
3. Description: `Professional AutoCAD dimensioning automation toolkit with modern GUI`
4. Set to **Public** (since it's your public account)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click **Create repository**

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these instead:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git

# Push everything to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual values.**

### Example:
If your username is `johndoe` and repository is `autocad-toolkit`:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/autocad-toolkit.git
git push -u origin main
```

## 🎯 After Pushing

### On Your Father's PC:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
cd REPOSITORY_NAME

# Set up environment
setup.bat

# Test with AutoCAD
run_gui.bat
```

## 📋 Repository Contents

Your repository will include:
- 🏗️ **Complete AutoCAD toolkit** with modern GUI
- 🎨 **Professional dark theme** with Google-style fonts  
- 📦 **All dependencies** listed in requirements.txt
- 🔧 **Easy setup scripts** (setup.bat, run_gui.bat)
- 📚 **Documentation** and installation guides
- 🚀 **Production-ready code** with proper structure

## 🔒 Authentication

If GitHub asks for authentication:
- **Username**: Your GitHub username
- **Password**: Use a Personal Access Token (not your account password)
  - Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Generate new token
  - Select "repo" permissions
  - Use this token as your password
