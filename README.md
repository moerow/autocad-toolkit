## 🚨 IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR CLAUDE CODE

### This is NOT a prototype - it's production software that must:
1. **Work with real AutoCAD drawings** (messy, complex, various standards)
2. **Be 100% accurate** (construction tolerances are strict)
3. **Have a beautiful modern GUI** (will be used 8 hours/day)
4. **Handle all edge cases** (real drawings have inconsistencies)

### Key Technical Points:
- We read **ACTUAL coordinates** from AutoCAD via COM interface (NOT image processing)
- We process **directly in memory** (no Excel export needed)
- We support **any drawing convention** (configurable layer names)
- We use **CustomTkinter** for modern GUI (not basic tkinter)

## 📋 Complete Feature Requirements

### 1. Automatic Dimensioning System

**Current Problem**: Manually dimensioning a floor plan with 50 walls takes 2-3 hours.

**🔥 NEW: AI-Powered Solution**:
```python
# Traditional Method (still available):
dimension_service = DimensionService(cad_connection)
results = dimension_service.dimension_all_lines(layer_filter="WALLS")

# AI-Powered Method (new):
ai_results = dimension_service.dimension_all_lines_ai(layer_filter="WALLS")
# AI automatically:
# 1. Analyzes drawing context and type
# 2. Classifies entities by importance (Critical/Important/Detail/Ignore)
# 3. Uses neural networks trained on professional DWG files
# 4. Dimensions intelligently following learned patterns
# 5. Achieves 95%+ accuracy matching professional standards
```

**Required Implementation**:
```python
# The system must:
1. Detect all geometric entities (lines, polylines, circles, arcs)
2. Identify walls (parallel line pairs = wall with thickness)
3. Place dimensions intelligently:
   - No overlaps
   - Consistent spacing (500mm default offset)
   - Proper text orientation
   - Dimension chains for connected walls
4. Support multiple entity types:
   - Lines → Linear dimensions
   - Circles → Diameter dimensions
   - Arcs → Radius dimensions
   - Polylines → Segment dimensions
5. Handle edge cases:
   - Very short walls (< min_length)
   - Angled walls
   - Curved walls
   - Overlapping geometry
```

**Example Usage**:
```python
# User workflow:
1. Open drawing with walls on layer "WALL"
2. Click "Connect" in toolkit
3. Choose "AI Dimension" or "Traditional Dimension"
4. Done - all walls dimensioned in seconds with professional accuracy
```

### 2. AI-Powered Compliance Checker

**Current Problem**: Manually checking if shelter designs meet building codes (PDF documents).

**Required Implementation**:
```python
# The system must:
1. Extract rules from PDF building codes:
   - Use OpenAI API to parse natural language
   - Fallback to regex patterns
   - Support multiple languages

2. Rule types to support:
   - Minimum values (wall thickness >= 300mm)
   - Maximum values (room area <= 50m²)
   - Exact values (door width == 900mm)
   - Range values (ceiling height 2.4-3.0m)
   - Boolean rules (must have emergency exit)

3. Check drawing elements:
   - Wall thickness (parallel line distance)
   - Door/window dimensions (block sizes)
   - Room areas (closed polyline areas)
   - Clearances and spacing
   - Structural requirements

4. Violation handling:
   - Mark violations visually (red circles)
   - Add text annotations
   - Group nearby violations
   - Color-code by severity

5. Generate reports:
   - JSON for data exchange
   - HTML for viewing
   - PDF for officials
   - Excel for analysis
```

**Example Rule Extraction**:
```
PDF Text: "All load-bearing walls must be at least 300mm thick"
Extracted Rule: ComplianceRule(
    name="load_bearing_wall_thickness",
    type=MINIMUM,
    value=300,
    unit="mm",
    category=WALL
)
```

### 3. Drawing Generation Tools

**Current Problem**: Creating standard drawings from scratch takes hours.

**Required Implementation**:
```python
# The system must generate:

1. Title Blocks:
   - All standard sizes (A0-A4)
   - Company information fields
   - Project details
   - Revision tracking
   - Drawing index

2. Floor Plans from specifications:
   Input: rooms = [
       {"name": "Living Room", "width": 5000, "height": 4000},
       {"name": "Kitchen", "width": 3000, "height": 3500}
   ]
   Output: Complete floor plan with:
   - Walls (double lines with thickness)
   - Doors (with swing arcs)
   - Windows (with sills)
   - Room labels and areas
   - Dimensions

3. Standard Construction Details:
   - Foundation sections
   - Wall sections
   - Door/window details
   - Structural connections
```

### 4. Modern GUI Requirements

**Must use CustomTkinter with**:
```python
# Main Window Structure:
- Sidebar navigation (fixed 250px width)
- Tab-based content area
- Status bar with progress
- Dark/Light theme toggle
- Connection status indicator

# Color Scheme:
colors = {
    'success': '#00b894',  # Green

            # Check if parallel (within 1 degree)
            if self.are_parallel(line1, line2, tolerance=0.017):
                distance = self.get_parallel_distance(line1, line2)
                
                # Typical wall thickness: 100-400mm
                if 100 <= distance <= 400:
                    walls.append({
                        'inner': line1,
                        'outer': line2,

    Text: {text}
    """
    
    # 3. Parse AI response
