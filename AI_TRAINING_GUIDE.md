# AI Dimensioning Training Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to provide your professional DWG files to train the AI dimensioning system. The system learns from your existing professionally dimensioned drawings to automatically dimension new drawings following the same standards and patterns.

## What The AI System Does

The AI system analyzes your finished DWG files to learn:
- **Entity Recognition**: Which objects are critical vs. detail elements
- **Dimensioning Patterns**: Where professionals typically place dimensions
- **Drawing Context**: Understanding different drawing types (plans, sections, details)
- **Professional Standards**: Following industry conventions for dimension placement

## How to Provide Your DWG Files

### 1. Directory Structure

Create a dedicated directory for your training files:

```
C:\AutoCAD_Training_Data\
├── floor_plans\
│   ├── residential\
│   ├── commercial\
│   └── industrial\
├── sections\
│   ├── building_sections\
│   ├── wall_sections\
│   └── structural_sections\
├── details\
│   ├── construction_details\
│   ├── connection_details\
│   └── assembly_details\
├── site_plans\
├── elevations\
└── electrical_plans\
```

### 2. File Organization Guidelines

**Naming Convention:**
- Use descriptive names: `FloorPlan_Office_Building_A.dwg`
- Include project type: `Detail_Wall_Section_Masonry.dwg`
- Avoid special characters: Use underscores instead of spaces

**File Quality Requirements:**
- ✅ **Fully dimensioned drawings** (this is critical!)
- ✅ **Professional standard dimensions** (proper placement, text size)
- ✅ **Clean layer structure** (proper layer naming)
- ✅ **Complete drawings** (not work-in-progress)
- ❌ Avoid drawings with missing dimensions
- ❌ Avoid corrupted or damaged files

### 3. Recommended File Types

**High Priority for Training:**
- **Floor Plans**: Residential, commercial, industrial
- **Sections**: Building sections, wall details
- **Construction Details**: Connection details, assembly drawings
- **Site Plans**: Building layout, parking, landscaping

**Medium Priority:**
- Elevations, electrical plans, plumbing plans

**Drawing Scales:**
- Include various scales (1:100, 1:50, 1:20, 1:10, 1:5)
- Mix of scales helps AI understand different detail levels

## Training Process

### Step 1: Initial Setup
```python
# Run this in your AutoCAD environment
from src.infrastructure.ai.dimension_ai import DWGAnalyzer
from src.infrastructure.autocad.connection import AutoCADConnection

# Initialize the analyzer
analyzer = DWGAnalyzer(storage_path="C:/AutoCAD_Training_Data/ai_training_data")
cad_connection = AutoCADConnection()
```

### Step 2: Batch Analysis
```python
# Analyze all DWG files in a directory
training_examples = analyzer.batch_analyze_dwgs(
    dwg_directory="C:/AutoCAD_Training_Data/floor_plans",
    cad_connection=cad_connection
)
```

### Step 3: Train Neural Network Models with Hyperparameter Tuning
```python
from src.infrastructure.ai.ai_trainer import AdvancedDimensionAITrainer

# Initialize advanced neural network trainer
trainer = AdvancedDimensionAITrainer(storage_path="C:/AutoCAD_Training_Data/ai_training_data")

# Train all models with automatic hyperparameter tuning
performance = trainer.train_all_models()
print(f"Training completed with accuracy: {performance['entity_importance'].accuracy:.2f}")
print(f"Ensemble accuracy: {performance['entity_importance'].ensemble_accuracy:.2f}")
print(f"Validation accuracy: {performance['entity_importance'].val_accuracy:.2f}")
```

### Step 4: Incremental Training (Add New Files)
```python
# Add new DWG files to existing trained model
new_files = [
    "C:/AutoCAD_Training_Data/new_projects/office_building_2024.dwg",
    "C:/AutoCAD_Training_Data/new_projects/residential_complex.dwg"
]

# Perform incremental training
performance = trainer.incremental_training(new_files, cad_connection)
print(f"Incremental training completed with improved accuracy: {performance['entity_importance'].accuracy:.2f}")
```

## What Happens During Training

### 1. Data Extraction Phase
- **Geometry Analysis**: Extracts all entities (lines, arcs, circles, polylines)
- **Dimension Analysis**: Captures all dimension objects and their properties
- **Relationship Mapping**: Links dimensions to the entities they measure
- **Layer Analysis**: Understands layer naming conventions
- **Drawing Classification**: Identifies drawing types automatically

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **Entity Features**: Length, area, position, layer, line type, color
- **Context Features**: Drawing type, scale, overall complexity
- **Relationship Features**: Which entities are typically dimensioned together
- **Spatial Features**: Proximity relationships, alignment patterns

### 3. Model Training
- **Entity Importance Classifier**: Learns which entities are critical/important/detail
- **Dimension Placement Predictor**: Learns optimal dimension positioning
- **Drawing Context Analyzer**: Understands different drawing types
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluates dimensioning completeness

## Training Data Storage

### Database Structure
The system stores training data in SQLite database:
- `training_examples`: Master list of analyzed drawings
- `geometry_features`: All extracted entities with properties
- `dimension_features`: All dimensions with measurements
- `entity_dimension_relationships`: Links between entities and dimensions

### File Storage
```
C:\AutoCAD_Training_Data\
├── ai_training_data\
│   ├── training_data.db          # SQLite database
│   ├── models\
│   │   ├── entity_importance_model.pkl
│   │   ├── dimension_placement_model.pkl
│   │   ├── feature_scaler.pkl
│   │   └── training_metadata.json
│   └── logs\

    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a professional CAD dimensioning expert..."

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **File Access Errors**: Ensure AutoCAD can open all DWG files
2. **Missing Dimensions**: System requires professionally dimensioned drawings
3. **Layer Issues**: Clean up layer naming for better results
4. **Performance**: Large datasets may require more RAM/processing time

### Support
- Check training logs for detailed error messages
- Use `analyzer.get_training_statistics()` for progress monitoring
- Contact support with training logs if issues persist

## Model Lifecycle & Continuous Learning

### One Model, Continuous Improvement
**Yes, this is one primary model that you'll always use**, but it gets smarter over time:

1. **Initial Training**: Train on your existing professional DWG files
2. **Production Use**: Use the trained model for daily dimensioning work
3. **Continuous Learning**: Periodically add new high-quality DWG files
4. **Incremental Training**: Retrain the model to improve accuracy

### Model Versioning
```python
# Check current model version
stats = trainer.get_model_statistics()
print(f"Current model version: {stats['training_metadata']['model_versions']}")
print(f"Training date: {stats['training_metadata']['training_date']}")
print(f"Accuracy: {stats['training_metadata']['performance_metrics']['entity_importance']['accuracy']:.2f}")
```

### When to Retrain
- **Monthly**: Add new completed projects (recommended)
- **Quarterly**: Full retraining with all accumulated data
- **New Project Types**: When working on different building types
- **Accuracy Drop**: If model performance degrades over time

### Backup & Version Control
```python
# Backup current model before retraining
import shutil
from datetime import datetime

backup_path = f"C:/AutoCAD_Training_Data/model_backups/{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}"
shutil.copytree("C:/AutoCAD_Training_Data/ai_training_data/models", backup_path)
```

### Model Performance Monitoring
```python
# Monitor model performance over time
def monitor_model_performance(trainer):
    stats = trainer.get_model_statistics()
    
    # Log performance metrics
    print(f"Entity Classification Accuracy: {stats['training_metadata']['performance_metrics']['entity_importance']['accuracy']:.2f}")
    print(f"Ensemble Accuracy: {stats['training_metadata']['performance_metrics']['entity_importance']['ensemble_accuracy']:.2f}")
    print(f"Total Training Examples: {stats['training_metadata']['total_examples']}")
    
    # Check if retraining is needed
    if stats['training_metadata']['performance_metrics']['entity_importance']['accuracy'] < 0.90:
        print("⚠️  Model accuracy below 90% - Consider retraining with more data")
    else:
        print("✅ Model performance is good")
```
